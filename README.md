# Diamond Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on key attributes using machine learning. A cleaned dataset of diamond characteristics was utilized, and a Random Forest Regressor model was trained to achieve the predictions.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains *53,940 rows* and *10 columns*, each representing attributes of diamonds such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and price. The data was preprocessed and cleaned for optimal model training and testing.

## Model

- *Model Used*: RandomForestRegressor
- *Test Size*: 20% of the dataset was used as the test set.
- *Evaluation Metric*: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- *Achieved RMSE*: 896

The model was chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and provide feature importance insights.
